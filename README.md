### Darkest Night

##### A GBCompo 2023 game entry

#### Description

Welcome to the small, vaguely eastern European town of Krew. Home of many small town people, a few farms and a church.

On the outskirts, you lie.

A monster.

A hunter looking for it's next meal.

Hunt livestock before eventually going after stronger prey, but watch out; The hunters guild is already aware of you and have sent adventurers to kill you.

Will you get strong enough to repel them? or will you perish by their blades and spells?
